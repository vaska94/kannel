2024-05-14  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr_spool.c: fix crutial DLR lookup bug for SMSC modules that DO use
      the destination address in the DLR find function. We used a hex string
      of the destination address as filname surrogate, and need to ensure we
      do the same hex string conversion when doing the lookup, i.e. CIMD2 
      was broken for DLR support via spool.

2023-04-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add '[forced|max]-priority' to the
      'sendsms-user' context group.
    * gw/smsbox.c: add handling of '[forced|max]-priority' for sendsms-user.
    * gw/urltrans.[ch]: add external access functions for above priority
      handling.
      
2023-04-21  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: add missing handling of '[allowed|denied]-prefix[-regex]' 
      for 'group = sendsms-user' group in function smsbox_req_handle().
    * gw/urltrans.[ch]: add external access functions for above prefix rules.

2023-02-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc_emi.c: allow support for MO only inbound UCP connections via
      'receive-port', without the need to define for outbound UCP connections
       via 'host' and 'port' settings.
       
2023-02-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: avoid sms_split() in send_message() to work-arround the 
      limitations of the extract_msgdata_part_by_coding() function that does
      a UTF-8 to GSM and back to UTF-8 transcoding, effectively lossing chars
      that are not part of GSM, but COULD be transported in the lower SMSC
      protoocol implementation layer. 
      
2023-02-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document %x and %y escape codes.
    * gw/urltrans.c: ensure we have %x for smsbox-id and %y for priority.
    
2022-09-13 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_store_redis.c: fixed usage in hash mode. Use SCAN instead of KEYS command,
      because KEYS block whole redis. Added usage of return values.

2022-09-13 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * gwlib/dbpool_redis.c: added handling of array in array, recursively.

2022-09-13 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * configure.in, configure: applied patch to use pkg-config for libxml2 version
      detection. Fixes #830. Thanks to hugh.mcmaster at outlook.com for this patch.

2022-08-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: fix missing content-type value setting for HTTP
      POST sending.

2022-05-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: add comment about default smsbox-route.
    * gw/bb_boxc.c: allow setting a default 'group = smsbox-route' without
      smsc-id or shortcode criteria.
    
2022-04-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/conn.c: change previous fix to be more protective for any 
      additional data reads.
    Thanks to Alexander Malysh for pointing this better alternative out.
      
2022-04-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/conn.c: fix assertion check PANIC if negative length is read in
      conn_read_withlen(), as we then would traverse into unlocked_get() and
      then into octstr_copy() with a negative length, causing the gw_assert()
      to PANIC.
      
2022-01-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.c: increase log-file limit at least to thread limit, 4096.
    
2022-01-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: ensure we add -ldl to LDFLAGS if not in glibc, this is at
      least the case for debian-11.
     
2022-01-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/wap_push_ota.c: ensure we have static definitions of variables, since
      wap/wtp_resp.c defines it already public, and we run into linker error on
      gcc-10 platforms.
      
2021-11-24  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-timer.[ch]: add function variants for callback timed events, 
      suffixed with _cb() that do not lock the Timerset, since the callback 
      function runs within the locked watch loop and would cause a dead-lock
      if using the functions that are used for queue pushed timer events.
    * test/Makefile.am: add test_timeset.c build instruction.
    * test/test_timerset.c: add a simple testing case.  
    
2021-10-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_http.c: ensure we provide an adequate 'Content-Type' header value
      with a MIME type that is requested via the /status.<suffix>.
      
2021-08-14 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * gwlib/cfg.c: fixed config parsing error log

2021-03-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * utils/mtbatch.c: add support for various codings (7bit, 8bit, Unicode) via
      '-c coding' and character transocing via option '-C charset'.
      
2021-03-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>

      from a group.
      
2020-06-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * bb_smscconn.c: fix smsc2_remove_smsc() which didn't calibrate the i counter
      when a SMSC connection is removed, so we would step over one index in the list
      without trying to match it's smsc-id, and fix smsc2_add_smsc() for SMSC group
      with multiple instances indicated, this would only start-up one instance, 
      even if several would be configured.
    Thanks to Roberto Facchin for providing the reporting.

2020-06-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document new 'reroute-receiver-regex' directive.
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: handle 'reroute-receiver-regex' in route_incoming_to_smsc().
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add a List in struct smscconn for reroute-receiver-regex.
    * gw/smscconn.c: init and de-init handling of reroute-receiver-regex.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: add directive 'reroute-receiver-regex'.
    This patchset allows defining regex patterns for receiver numbers when doing 
    re-routing of MOs towards MTs.
    
2020-06-03  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c, test/fakesmsc.c: add type 'utf8' to allow simple
      injection of UTF-8 encoded MOs.
      
2020-05-04 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.[ch]: added http PATCH method support

2020-03-30  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr_redis.c: fix dlr_redis_update() to get correct DLR entry updates,
      i.e. for intermediate events.

2020-01-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, doc/userguide.xml, gwlib/cfg.def: added new config
      option to retry even if SMSC rejects login due to wrong username & password.

2020-01-06 Alexander Malysh <amalysh @ kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml, gw/urltrans.c: added %U escape code for
      hexcoded UDH.

2019-12-10  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: fixed last commit, wrong XML struct.
    Thanks to Alexander Malysh for pointing to this.
    
2019-12-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: allow using the 'alt-charset' usage in the MT
      direction too, to transcode the payload before URL-encoding and 
      setting the corresponding charset="" value in the content-type header
      for HTTP POST methods.
      
2019-12-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document 'use-post' for generic type
      of HTTP SMSC.
    * gw/smsc_http_p.h: add use_post flag.
    * gw/smsc_http.c: use 'use-post' boolean config from 'group = smsc'.
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: implement HTTP POST method support for the
      sending and receiving side of the 'system-type = generic'.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: add 'use-post' config directive to 'group = smsc'.
    * gwlib/http.[ch]: export function parse_cgivars() publically.
    This patchset adds support for the HTTP POST method for the SMSC HTTP
    type 'generic'. Handling long Unicode messages can easily exceed the
    max length limits of HTTP GET URLs on various HTTP servers and HTTP
    proxy components, causing HTTP/502 and other defects in processing.
    Now we can use content-type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' data
    in the HTTP POST body to overcome those limitations if necessary.
    
2019-12-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: clarify dlr-url and dlr-mask usage in
      'group = sendsms-user' contexts.
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix non-working 'dlr-url' for 'group = sendsms-user',
      which would never trigger the if statement, since the upper layer
      of the sendsms HTTP interface would init msg->sms.dlr_url with a 
      empty string; now we handle also a 'dlr-mask' in the group as
      default value if no HTTP GET paramter is presented.
    * gw/urltrans.c: ensure we also use 'dlr-mask' as config directive in
      the 'group = sendsms-user' context as possible default.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: add 'dlr-mask' to 'group = sendsms-user'.
    This patchset fixes the default 'dlr-url' handling for the sendsms-user
    group handling, where the default would effetively never be handled.    
      
2019-11-27  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: fix missing DLR SMSC FAIL payload <NACK/xxx> for 
      concatenated messages.

      gw/smsc/smsc_http_p.h, gwlib/cfg.def: applied patch from Franck Lamasuta.
      Main changes:
        - Better support of Clickatell HTTP API (Developer’s Central): from, mo, validity and callback parameters

      be initialized with random value on MacOS X 10.11.x (clang-800.0.42.1), 
      but is then used  in the following up call to date_convert_universal(), so 
      make sure we set this to zero as we're handlign GMT times anyway. NLC.

    * gw/bb_boxc.c: use init_smsbox_routes() for initial and reload cases, use
      smsbox_restart() to reload smsbox routing.
    * gw/bb_http.c: interpret bb_graceful_restart() outcome in HTTP admin command
      function httpd_graceful_restart().
    * gw/bearerbox.c: use gw_log_force() for starting/stopping log evetns that
      we want to see in the log, no matter waht log-level is used (forced),
      reload config in bb_graceful_restart() and call the sub-module reload
      functions.
    * gw/bearebox.h: change prototype for smsc2_graceful_restart().
    This patchsets implement the reloading (aka graceful restart) capabilities
    for the MO direction smsbox routing groups.
